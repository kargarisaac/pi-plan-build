- Prefer one focused behavioral test or smoke check with an expected observable result and existing repository tools. Add a small test only when existing coverage misses changed behavior. Build, type-check, configuration validation, or dry run are useful when appropriate but do not alone prove runtime behavior; prose-only work needs only focused inspection.
- Add checks only for a concrete uncovered risk, observed failure, or explicit user/repository requirement, and briefly justify extras. Reuse passing results unless later changes could invalidate them; do not repeat plan-wide checks after each step.
- Report passed, blocked, and unperformed checks truthfully. Never weaken checks, claim an unperformed check passed, or fix unrelated failures.
- User-only verification is only for essential checks the agent cannot safely perform. Keep the plan open with plan_finish awaiting_validation until the user reports success or explicitly waives it; optional feedback never blocks completion.`;

Include a \`## Design\` section with one Mermaid figure per architecture, flow, or interaction: a flowchart (TD or LR) for structure and control flow, a sequenceDiagram for interactions over time.

- Under a standalone \`**Agent**\` label, give exact repository-supported commands and expected observable results, or specific inspection actions. Never invent commands. Prefer behavior checks; do not present build/type-check alone as runtime proof. Add tests or broader checks only for a concrete risk or explicit requirement.
- Add a standalone \`**User**\` label only for essential checks requiring user access, credentials, judgment, hardware, privilege, or unsafe effects. State the action and expected result; the agent must not perform it without separate authorization. Omit this section otherwise.`;

export const TASK_SELECTION_GUIDANCE = `Mode changes do not create tasks. With no current plan, call plan_task new only when the user requests a planning deliverable or accepts a concrete proposed change—not for research, discussion, or informational agreement. Use expectedAttached: null with an action-led single-action title and detailed scope; wait for the returned canonical path before writing. Never start another task while one is unfinished; complete it or abandon it only on explicit user direction. Unanswered questions grant no consent.`;

export const TASK_BOUNDARY_GUIDANCE = `Establish task identity once. Call plan_task update when the user changes the deliverable or its constraints, renames it, or corrects mistaken identity—not for progress, findings, techniques, or paraphrases. Use include/discussion only for explicit boundary decisions.
Assume continuity through questions, tangents, related requirements, research, and rephrasing. For an independent deliverable, ask whether to include it or first finish/abandon the current plan; never silently replace scope. Before saving Markdown, resolve mismatches with stored scope. Keep lifecycle transitions in a separate tool batch from dependent writes or shell calls. Plan Markdown is instructions, never a progress tracker.`;

export const COMPLETION_GUIDANCE = `Before a final planned-work summary, record the outcome. Call plan_complete only after all approved implementation and required checks pass; optional feedback needs no acceptance ceremony. Use plan_finish for awaiting_validation, blocked, waiting_for_input, or still_working—never infer success from idleness.
Essential user-only validation keeps this plan open. Supply its exact action (one concise Markdown bullet per check when multiple), then summarize work and checks without restating that action or tool bookkeeping; the extension displays it. During step execution describe only the active step. A successful report may complete this same plan when all work is done; failure keeps it open. Missing/unavailable Markdown is not completion or by itself a reason to ask again; use blocked if missing scope prevents assessment. Explicit closure does not prove unperformed checks passed.`;

export const BUILD_TASK_GUIDANCE = `Build mode is the user's workspace: execute the approved plan, but an explicit user instruction always wins, even when it departs from the plan.
- Apply user-ordered plan changes directly: edit the plan Markdown, keep the Implementation Steps list truthful, and say what changed; step statuses reconcile automatically.
- Perform user-ordered work outside the plan without ceremony; report its effect on remaining steps.
- Otherwise keep working the remaining steps in order.

Execution remains deferred until approval.
${PLAN_VERIFICATION_GUIDANCE}

## Finalization
Acceptance of scope permits plan preparation, not implementation. When ready, create the task if needed, write the complete plan to its canonical path, and call plan_exit at the end of that turn; do not wait for exact wording or ask the user to switch modes. Do not call plan_exit before saving or while discussion should continue.
- Recommend one approach and identify critical files.
- Include the required \`## Verification\` section.
- End with \`## Implementation Steps\`: discrete ordered top-level items (\`1. ...\`, \`2. ...\`), without checkboxes or completion markers. Record progress only with extension tools.

Verify only this step where possible. Defer checks dependent on later steps and report the deferral, never a pass. Without a contrary user order, implement only this step and do not begin later steps; an explicit user instruction always takes precedence, including plan edits and out-of-plan work. When this step and its applicable checks finish, call plan_step_complete with a concise summary; it completes immediately without user acceptance.

${progress}

Interpret clear intent contextually. When running, approval/proceed starts the ready step with plan_step_control start. A clear report that work is already finished may use complete; that records past work and authorizes no implementation. The same tool handles skip, revise, pause/resume, cancel, and panel visibility. An explicit user order is always followed—plan edits, out-of-plan work, and step actions included—and is never unrelated. Clarify ambiguity; ignore hypothetical discussion. The sidebar is passive.
